# Hello there! ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ ✨



I am Parnika, a sophomore in college, guiding myself through the world of Computer Science and Art 🌱🌿

I like playing around with tech as I find ways to add my own touch to things. I try to customize everything I come across and strive for keeping them fresh, intuitive and efficient in the best sense 🍵🥐

Also count me as a Game dev+Web dev enthusiast, I like working with 3D in Blender (I have a degree in art too btw) 👀
